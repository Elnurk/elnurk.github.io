# Elnur Khalmetov Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source for my personal portfolio website hosted at **elnurk.github.io**. The site showcases my engineering and robotics projects, provides a short biography, lists my skills, and gives visitors a way to contact me.

## Features
- **Bilingual**: English and Japanese versions of every page with a simple language toggle (`EN/日本語`).
- **Responsive layout**: Mobile‑first design with a top navigation bar, hero section with a collage header image, skills section, project grid, and footer contacts.
- **Projects showcase**: Each project card includes an image, title and brief description, and links out to the corresponding GitHub repository or project page.
- **Contact and skills**: My key skills (CAD/FEA, programming languages, fluency in English, Kazakh, Russian, and Japanese JLPT N2) are presented as badges. Contact links include email, LinkedIn and GitHub.
- **No build step**: Pure HTML, CSS and SVG assets. Simply push updates to the `main` branch and GitHub Pages serves the latest version.

## Usage
Clone or fork this repository and edit the HTML files under the root directory:

- **index.html** – English homepage
- **ja/index.html** – Japanese homepage
- **cv.html** – CV / resume page (placeholder)
- **assets/** – CSS files, images and icons used by the site

To host your own copy on GitHub Pages, enable Pages in the repository settings and set the source to the `main` branch. The `.nojekyll` file ensures GitHub Pages doesn’t run a Jekyll build.
